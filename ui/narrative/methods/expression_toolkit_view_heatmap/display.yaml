parameters :
    cluster_object :
        ui-name : |
            Feature Clusters
        short-hint : |
            Select the clustering output to be visualized
    min_features :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Number of Features
        short-hint : |
            Minimum number of features to be displayed in the heatmap. It must not be greater than the number of features associated with the expression matrix. The heatmap may display additional features to ensure that all the selected clusters are shown in full.
    figure_object :
        ui-name : |
            Output Figure
        short-hint : |
            Name of the multi-cluster heatmap object
    fold_change :
        ui-name : |
            Fold Change Plot
        short-hint : |
            Select if you want fold change plot. By default, heatmap shows original expression values instead of log2 fold change values
    control_condition :
        ui-name : |
            Control Condition
        short-hint : |
            Name of the control condition. Default is the name of first sample.
    quantile:
        ui-name : |
            Quantile Level
        short-hint : |
            Standard deviation quantile of log2 fold change for a given cluster.
        long-hint  : |
            Quantile level of 1 means largest log2 fold change standard deviation, 0 means smallest, and 0.5 means median. Default is 0.75.
    quantile_weight :
        ui-name : |
            Quantile Weight
        short-hint : |
            Provide a relative weight for normalied quantile std. over normalized mean correlation of a cluster
        long-hint  : |
            1.0 means we treat normalized mean correlation to be equal weight to normalized quantile std. and 0.0 means we only consider normalized mean correlation for cluster selection criteria. Please refer to description for more details on normalization.
    fold_cutoff :
        ui-name : |
            Fold Normalization Option
        short-hint : |
            Select how you would like to normalize (cutoff or rescale) the log2 fold change values to +/-Fold Normalization Range around zero. Default is cutoff.
    fold_change_range :
        ui-name : |
            Fold Normalization Range
        short-hint : |
            The +/- range around zero within which all log2 fold change values must lie. Default is +/-2.
description : |
    <p> This method displays multi-cluster heatmap of expressed genes. The user can modulate the output of the heatmap by varying the minimum number of features required while making sure that all the related clusters are shown in full in the heatmap. The heatmap shows original expression values by default.</p>

    <p> The advanced options allow the user to enable the display log2 fold change values in the heatmap. In the later case, the user can further select the quantile level of the standard deviation of log2 fold change, quantile weight, fold normalization option and the fold normalization range so that the selected clusters are most coherent with respect to features and most diverse with respect to conditions.</p>
