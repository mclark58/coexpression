    <p>This method displays the P-value distribution of differentially expressed genes to filter an expression matrix based on P-value cutoff or number of features.</p>

    <p>Description of filtering methods to do differential Expression:
        <ul>
        <li>Log odds ratio is a statistical test that calculates the logarithm of the ratio of the odds for regulation to the odds against regulation to measure association between the variables.</li>
        <li>ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) is a statistical test for measurement of heterogeneity of means by analysis of group variances.</li>
        </ul>
