            The input ExpressionMatrix object. Choose an Expression Matrix from your Data Panel to supply the input data for this App. You can also upload an Expression Matrix into your Narrative by clicking the <i>+</i> button in the Data Panel, selecting the <i>Import</i> tab, and following the instructions. For imported Expression Matrices please run <i>Associate Expression Matrix to Genome Features<i> before running this App in order for the ExpressionMatrix to contain proper links to a Genome in KBase.

    <p>This App displays the P-value distribution of differentially expressed genes to allow filtering of an ExpressionMatrix based on a P-value cutoff or number of features.</p>

    <p>Users provide an input ExpressionMatrix object either from KBase RNAseq analysis Apps or from a user data upload, where the ExpressionMatrix contains two (and only two) data columns, one for case A (e.g. expression in a Treatment sample) and one for case B (e.g. expression in a WT sample). A ‘Filter Method Option’ is required to set the method used to compute P-values and the default is ‘Log Odds Ratio’. Finally, users need to provide a name prefix for the objects generated as a result of running this App.</p>

    <p>There are three controls available in the plot itself. The first allows users to control the number of bins used for the differential expression p-value data. The second two allow users to set the differential expression value of the genes to a minimal value (‘Expression level at least’) and/or a maximal value (‘Expression level at most’). The ‘Details’ button will toggle the details section of the report which contains information about the generated object such as identifiers, versions, and timestamps.</p>

    <p>Description of filtering methods for differential Expression data:
      <ul>
        <li>The Log Odds Ratio (LOR) is a statistical test that calculates the logarithm of the ratio of the odds for case A (e.g. expression in Treatment sample) to the odds for case B (e.g. expression in a WT sample), to measure the statistical association between the two variables.</li>
        <li>ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) is a statistical test for the measurement of differences in group means by analysis of group variances.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
