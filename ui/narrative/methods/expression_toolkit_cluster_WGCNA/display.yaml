    <p>This App uses Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to find clusters of highly correlated genes based on large, high-dimensional datasets obtained from RNA-seq or microarray experiments in the form of an expression matrix.</p>

    <p>It clusters similarly correlated genes into groups called modules, which can be further analyzed using functional information such as GO, KEGG, etc. Instead of relating thousands of genes to a sample trait, it tries to capture the relationship between typically a dozen modules and the sample trait.</p>


    <p><strong>Team members who developed & deployed algorithm in KBase:</strong> Shinjae Yoo, Fei He, Sunita Kumari, Priya Ranjan, Srividya Ramakrishnan, Jim Thomason, and Vivek Kumar. For questions, please <a href="http://kbase.us/contact-us/">contact us</a>.</p>
