    expression :
        ui-name : |
            Expression Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Choose an ExpressionMatrix from your Data Panel to use with this method. You can upload an ExpressionMatrix into your Narrative by clicking the <i>Add Data</i> button and selecting the <i>Import</i> tab.
    filtered_expression:
        ui-name : |
            Filtered Expression Matrix
        short-hint : |
            The output filtered ExpressionMatrix.
    filtered_featureset :
        ui-name : |
            Filtered FeatureSet
        short-hint : |
            The output filtered FeatureSet.
    method :
        ui-name : |
            Filter Option
        short-hint : |
            Select the option to perform differential expression filtering: ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) or Log odd ratio. Default is ANOVA.
    num_features :
        ui-name : |
            Number of Features
        short-hint : |
            Number of features to retain in the filtered ExpressionMatrix.
    p_value :
        ui-name : |
            P-value Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            P-value cutoff to  filter expressed genes in the filtered ExpressionMatrix.
description : |
    <p>This App filters expressed genes from an ExpressionMatrix and generates a FeatureSet and filtered ExpressionMatrix. Begin by selecting or importing an ExpressionMatrix using the <i>Add Data<i> button. Select either of the filter options that use the number of features, or a P-value cutoff to filter differentially expressed genes. If both the number of features and the P-value cutoff are populated, the App will default to using the number of features as the selected filtering method.</p>

    <p>Description of filtering methods to do differential expression:
      <ul>
        <li>Log odds ratio is a statistical test that calculates the logarithm of the ratio of the odds for regulation to the odds against regulation to measure association between the variables.</li>
        <li>ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) is a statistical test for measurement of heterogeneity of means by analysis of group variances.</li>
      </ul>
